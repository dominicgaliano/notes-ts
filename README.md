# React + TypeScript + Vite Notes App

This project is a CRUD notes app. I originally built the front-end with React using vanilla JS. Now, I am starting to convert it to valid typescript. My goals after that is complete are to use this app to learn more backend functionality and improve my CSS skills.

Available commands:

```
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```
